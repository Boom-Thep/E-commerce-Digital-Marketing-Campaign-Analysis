# E-commerce Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis
## Project Summary
This project presents the dataset from e-commerce company's digital marketing campaigns conducted over one month, spanning February 1st to February 28th. The campaigns are set up by marketing team to attract more customer to the company's website. We are collaborating with the marketing team to assess the performance of these campaigns by analyzing the effectiveness of spending and the return on marketing investment. The KPIs we are investigating are:
- **ROMI:** Return on marketing investment
- **CPC:** Cost per clicks
- **CPL:** Cost per leads
- **CAC:** Customer acquisition cost (leads to orders)
- **Gross Profit or Loss:** revenue - marketing spent
  
Insights and recommendations find will be use by marketing team to allocate funding for performing campaign and reassess underperforming campaign to potentially minimize loss and increase profit.

## About The Dataset
**The datasets contain one table with a total of 11 column:**
- id: Unique identifier for each entry
- campaign_date: Date of the campaign
- campaign_name: Name of the campaign (with a total of 11 distinct campaign name)
- category: Category of the campaign (e.g., social, search, influencer, media)
- campaign_id: Unique identifier for each campaign
- impressions: Number of impressions generated by the campaign
- marketing_spent: Amount spent on the campaign
- clicks: Number of clicks received
- leads: Number of leads generated
- orders: Number of orders made
- revenue: Revenue generated from the campaign


## Executive Summary
The analysis revealed that the company's campaigns generated **$42.89M in revenue** with a **ROMI of 40.20%**, indicating efficient overall performance. The YouTube Blogger campaign emerged as the 
top performer with a **ROMI of 277%** and the highest **gross profit of $11.25M**, while Instagram campaigns (Blogger & Tier 1) also delivered strong results. However, several Facebook campaigns, particularly Facebook_lal, underperformed significantly with a negative **ROMI of -88.64% and a gross loss of $1M**, alongside Facebook_tier2 and Facebook_tier1, which also showed negative ROMIs and gross losses. Influencer marketing proved to be the most effective campaign type, boasting a **ROMI of 154.29%**, while social media campaigns struggled with a negative **ROMI of -13.68%**.

To address these challenges, it is recommended to increase investment in high-performing campaigns like YouTube Blogger and Instagram, while restructuring or pausing underperforming Facebook campaigns to improve their effectiveness. Additionally, enhancing conversion rates for underperforming campaigns and optimizing resource allocation across campaigns will further boost ROI and improve overall efficiency.

### Campaign-Level ROMI Analysis

- **Performing Campaign:** Youtube_blogger has the **highest ROMI (277.32%) and gross-profit ($11.2 Million)**, indicating a significant return on investment along with Facebook_retargeting campaign strong positive **ROMI (101.50%)**.

It is recommended to a marketing team to review these two campaigns and how are they different from other campaigns. 

- **Underperforming Campaigns:** Facebook_lal has the **lowest ROMI (-88.64%)**, indicating a significant loss on this campaign. Furthermore, both Facebook_tier 1 **(-6.57%)** and Facebook_tier2 **(-26.22%)** along with Instagram_tier2 **(-33.67%)** show negative ROMIs, suggesting that these campaigns are not generating sufficient revenue to cover their marketing costs. Moreover, three campaigns from Facebook generate a **significant amount of loss (approximately $3.7 Million)**.

### Campaign Category Effectiveness
- **Influencer Marketing:** Demonstrates a **strong return on investment (154.29%) despite a high CPC ($11.07) and CPL ($490.31)**. Notably, this campaign type achieved the **lowest CAC ($2,755.58)** while yielding the highest ROMI. This likely stems from **high total clicks (749,973) and a relatively high total leads (16,939)**, indicating influencer campaigns effectively drive traffic and generate leads. To optimize ROI, allocate more budget to influencer campaigns while reducing investment in less successful channels. Furthermore, the marketing team should implement strategies to increase the conversion rate from **leads to orders (3014 orders from 16,939 leads)**.

- **Media:** Produced **moderate results with 420,003 total clicks, 10,149 total leads, and 1566 total orders**, demonstrating effectiveness in driving traffic, generating leads, and producing orders. While the **CPC ($11.97) and CPL ($495.29)** are moderate, the **CAC ($3209.88)** is higher than influencer campaigns, indicating a higher cost per customer acquisition. Despite this, the campaign type still generated a moderate-to-high **ROMI (22.41%)**, highlighting its effectiveness.
  
- **Search:** Generated the **lowest total clicks (330,054), total leads (7107), and total orders (828)**, indicating weaker performance in driving traffic and generating leads. While the **CPC ($10.48) and CPL ($486.90)** are relatively low, suggesting lower costs for clicks and leads compared to influencer and media campaigns, the high **CAC ($4179.23)** reflects a significant cost to acquire customers. Due to these lower metrics, search campaigns generated a low **ROMI (7.07%)**, indicating a poor return on investment.
  
- **Social:** Despite **high total clicks (1,499,889) and total leads (31,384), along with the lowest CPC ($9.20) and CPL ($439.67**)—indicating effective social media campaigns in driving traffic and generating leads—the low conversion rate from **leads to orders (2,635 orders out of 31,384 leads)** and the **highest CAC ($5,236.62)** have resulted in a negative **ROMI (-13.68%)**. The marketing team should conduct a thorough analysis of all social media campaigns, focusing on factors such as:
  - Which platforms were used?
  - Which platforms generate the highest order-to-lead ratios?
  - Which platforms should be prioritized based on performance?
  - Which locations (Tier 1 or Tier 2) demonstrate higher conversion rates?
  - Which channels should have their budgets minimized or paused based on further review?

**Cost Efficiency Improvement**:
- **Lower Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Lead (CPL):** Focus on platforms and campaigns with the most efficient CPC and CPL (e.g., YouTube and Instagram). For Facebook campaigns with high CPC ($22.01) and CPL ($1,138.94), revise targeting to exclude less engaged audiences.
- **Optimize Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Shift focus to campaigns with the lowest CAC (e.g., YouTube Blogger with $2,120.13). Bundle offers to increase order values and offset higher CAC on other platforms.

**Channel Campaign Strategy**:
- **Influencer Campaign:** Allocate more budget to influencer campaigns while reducing investment in less successful channels. Moreover, expand partnerships by collaborating with additional influencers in niches similar to those in the YouTube Blogger campaign. Monitors influencer campaign engagement rates such as total clicks, leads, and orders to ensure high-quality partnerships.
- **Instagram Campaign:** Leverage Instagram Stories and Reels by utilizing video ads and interactive content to maximize engagement. Encourage user-generated content by launching challenges or hashtag campaigns. Collaborate with influencers and users to create fun, engaging content that drives traffic to our sites. Focus on targeting Tier 1 cities, as the Instagram_Tier1 campaign demonstrated a strong ROMI of 77.14%.
- **Facebook Campaign**: Analyze underperforming campaigns such as facebook_LAL, facebook_Tier2, and facebook_Tier1, and compare them to a more successful campaign from the same platform, such as facebook_Retargeting (ROMI: 101.50%). Evaluate whether the targeting criteria of the underperforming campaigns (e.g., location, interests, demographics) align with the intended audience. Investigate whether the underlying issues of these campaigns stem from differing targeting criteria compared to the facebook_Retargeting campaign.
 
**Geolocation Strategy**
- **Tier 1 Cities Prioritize Marketing Efforts:** Allocate more budget to Tier 1 while decreasing Tier 2 budget. Increase ad spend in Tier 1 cities, which have shown high revenue ($6.94M) and positive ROMI (35.29%). Tailor targeted ads to reflect local cultural trends and preferences within the city.

- **Tier 2 Cities Reassess Approach:** Focus on conducting research or surveys to understand audience behavior in Tier 2 cities. Afterward, Re-evaluate and test smaller campaigns with adjusted messaging and budgets. Explore alternative strategies or channels for reaching the target audience in Tier 2 cities.
