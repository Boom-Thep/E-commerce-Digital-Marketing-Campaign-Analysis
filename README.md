# E-commerce Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis
## Project Summary
This project presents the dataset from e-commerce company's digital marketing campaigns conducted over one month, spanning February 1st to February 28th. The campaigns are set up by marketing team to attract more customer to the company's website. We are collaborating with the marketing team to assess the performance of these campaigns by analyzing the effectiveness of spending and the return on marketing investment. The KPIs we are investigating are:
- **ROMI:** Return on marketing investment
- **CPC:** Cost per clicks
- **CPL:** Cost per leads
- **CAC:** Customer acquisition cost (leads to orders)
- **Gross Profit or Loss:** revenue - marketing spent
  
Insights and recommendations find will be use by marketing team to allocate funding for performing campaign and reassess underperforming campaign to potentially minimize loss and increase profit.

## About The Dataset
**The datasets contain one table with a total of 11 column:**
- id: Unique identifier for each entry
- campaign_date: Date of the campaign
- campaign_name: Name of the campaign (with a total of 11 distinct campaign name)
- category: Category of the campaign (e.g., social, search, influencer, media)
- campaign_id: Unique identifier for each campaign
- impressions: Number of impressions generated by the campaign
- marketing_spent: Amount spent on the campaign
- clicks: Number of clicks received
- leads: Number of leads generated
- orders: Number of orders made
- revenue: Revenue generated from the campaign


## Executive Summary
The analysis revealed that the company's campaigns generated **$42.89M in revenue** with a **ROMI of 40.20%**, indicating efficient overall performance. The YouTube Blogger campaign emerged as the 
top performer with a **ROMI of 277%** and the highest **gross profit of $11.25M**, while Instagram campaigns (Blogger & Tier 1) also delivered strong results. However, several Facebook campaigns, particularly Facebook_lal, underperformed significantly with a negative **ROMI of -88.64% and a gross loss of $1M**, alongside Facebook_tier2 and Facebook_tier1, which also showed negative ROMIs and gross losses. Influencer marketing proved to be the most effective campaign type, boasting a **ROMI of 154.29%**, while social media campaigns struggled with a negative **ROMI of -13.68%**.

To address these challenges, it is recommended to increase investment in high-performing campaigns like YouTube Blogger and Instagram, while restructuring or pausing underperforming Facebook campaigns to improve their effectiveness. Additionally, enhancing conversion rates for underperforming campaigns and optimizing resource allocation across campaigns will further boost ROI and improve overall efficiency.

### Campaign-Level ROMI Analysis

- **Performing Campaign:** Youtube_blogger has the **highest ROMI (277.32%) and gross-profit ($11.2 Million)**, indicating a significant return on investment along with Facebook_retargeting campaign strong positive **ROMI (101.50%)**.

### Campaign Category Effectiveness
- **Influencer Marketing:** Demonstrates a **strong return on investment (154.29%) despite a high CPC ($11.07) and CPL ($490.31)**. Notably, this campaign type achieved the **lowest CAC ($2,755.58)** while yielding the highest ROMI. This likely stems from **high total clicks (749,973) and a relatively high total leads (16,939)**, indicating influencer campaigns effectively drive traffic and generate leads. To optimize ROI, allocate more budget to influencer campaigns while reducing investment in less successful channels. Furthermore, the marketing team should implement strategies to increase the conversion rate from **leads to orders (3014 orders from 16,939 leads)**.

- **Media:** Produced **moderate results with 420,003 total clicks, 10,149 total leads, and 1566 total orders**, demonstrating effectiveness in driving traffic, generating leads, and producing orders. While the **CPC ($11.97) and CPL ($495.29)** are moderate, the **CAC ($3209.88)** is higher than influencer campaigns, indicating a higher cost per customer acquisition. Despite this, the campaign type still generated a moderate-to-high **ROMI (22.41%)**, highlighting its effectiveness.
  
- **Search:** Generated the **lowest total clicks (330,054), total leads (7107), and total orders (828)**, indicating weaker performance in driving traffic and generating leads. While the **CPC ($10.48) and CPL ($486.90)** are relatively low, suggesting lower costs for clicks and leads compared to influencer and media campaigns, the high **CAC ($4179.23)** reflects a significant cost to acquire customers. Due to these lower metrics, search campaigns generated a low **ROMI (7.07%)**, indicating a poor return on investment.
  
- **Social:** Despite **high total clicks (1,499,889) and total leads (31,384), along with the lowest CPC ($9.20) and CPL ($439.67**)—indicating effective social media campaigns in driving traffic and generating leads—the low conversion rate from **leads to orders (2,635 orders out of 31,384 leads)** and the **highest CAC ($5,236.62)** have resulted in a negative **ROMI (-13.68%)**. The marketing team should conduct a thorough analysis of all social media campaigns, focusing on factors such as:
  - Which platforms were used?
  - Which platforms generate the highest order-to-lead ratios?
  - Which platforms should be prioritized based on performance?
  - Which locations (Tier 1 or Tier 2) demonstrate higher conversion rates?
  - Which channels should have their budgets minimized or paused based on further review?

## Recommendation
**Allocate and Relocate Budget**:
- **Increase Budget:** Allocate more budget to campaigns with the highest ROMI and gross profit. Refer to the data below for insights on campaigns that achieved the highest ROMI and gross profit.
- **Pause or Minimize Budget:** Suspend or significantly reduce budgets for underperforming campaigns, such as facebook_LAL, which reported the highest losses (ROMI: -88.64%). Similarly, reduce budgets for facebook_Tier1 and facebook_Tier2 campaigns.
- **Reallocate Resources:** Shift resources from underperforming Facebook campaigns to high-performing YouTube and Instagram campaigns.

**Cost Efficiency Improvement**:
- **Lower Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Lead (CPL):** Focus on platforms and campaigns with the most efficient CPC and CPL (e.g., YouTube and Instagram). For Facebook campaigns with high CPC ($22.01) and CPL ($1,138.94), revise targeting to exclude less engaged audiences.

Focus on targeting Tier 1 cities, as the Instagram_Tier1 campaign demonstrated a strong ROMI of 77.14%.
- **Facebook Campaign**: Analyze underperforming campaigns such as facebook_LAL, facebook_Tier2, and facebook_Tier1, and compare them to a more successful campaign from the same platform, such as facebook_Retargeting (ROMI: 101.50%). Evaluate whether the targeting criteria of the underperforming campaigns (e.g., location, interests, demographics) align with the intended audience. Investigate whether the underlying issues of these campaigns stem from differing targeting criteria compared to the facebook_Retargeting campaign.
 
**Geolocation Strategy**
- **Tier 1 Cities Prioritize Marketing Efforts:** Allocate more budget to Tier 1 while decreasing Tier 2 budget. Increase ad spend in Tier 1 cities, which have shown high revenue ($6.94M) and positive ROMI (35.29%). Tailor targeted ads to reflect local cultural trends and preferences within the city.
